LSTM-Based Emotion Detection Using DAIR Dataset
Project Overview
This project implements an Emotion Detection System using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The model analyzes textual input and predicts the underlying human emotion from the DAIR Emotion Dataset. It is designed to demonstrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text classification using TensorFlow and Keras.

Features
Text preprocessing and tokenization

Emotion classification using LSTM

Predicts one of six emotions:

Sadness
Joy
